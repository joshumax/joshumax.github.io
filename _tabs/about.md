Hi there! My name is Josh Max, otherwise known online as "joshumax" in most places.
I'm a graduate student at the University of Washington specializing in embedded system design;
however I also like compilers, high-performance computing (HPC), penetration testing,
reverse engineering, OS design, game development, AI, and computer networking.

I work in aerospeace and defense for my day job, but after hours I prefer to work with the OSS
community as a low-level hacker and Free Software advocate.

My non-tech hobbies include astronomy, photography, reading, and travel (especially with a telescope).

I also construct goat teleporters during my free time. Follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/joshumax">@joshumax</a>
if you like hearing about strange gadgetry!
